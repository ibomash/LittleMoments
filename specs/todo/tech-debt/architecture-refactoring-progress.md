# Architecture Refactoring - Phase 1 Progress

## Accomplished Work

### DI Framework
- Created `DIContainer.swift` with a protocol and implementation
- Implemented core dependency injection mechanisms
- Added a `ServiceLocator` for centralized service management

### Service Protocols
- Defined `SettingsServiceProtocol` for settings management
- Defined `HealthKitServiceProtocol` for HealthKit access
- Defined `SoundServiceProtocol` for sound playback

### Service Implementations
- Implemented `SettingsServiceImpl` wrapping existing settings functionality
- Implemented `HealthKitServiceImpl` wrapping existing HealthKit access
- Implemented `SoundServiceImpl` wrapping existing sound playback

### Testing
- Created unit tests for the DI container
- Created unit tests for the settings service
- Created unit tests for the service locator

## Current Challenges

We're facing some technical challenges with the implementation:

1. **Module Organization**: The current project structure doesn't support proper module imports, leading to compilation errors.

2. **Circular Dependencies**: There are potential circular dependencies between services that need to be addressed.

3. **Xcode Project Structure**: The Xcode project needs to be updated to properly recognize the new files and organize them correctly.

4. **Test Execution**: The tests are encountering XCTest import issues that need to be resolved.

## Next Steps

To complete Phase 1 of the refactoring, we need to:

1. **Fix Project Structure**:
   - Update the Xcode project file to properly organize the new files
   - Ensure all imports work correctly

2. **Complete Service Integration**:
   - Finish connecting the services in the app's entry point
   - Update existing view components to use the new services

3. **Resolve Test Issues**:
   - Fix XCTest import problems
   - Ensure all tests run properly

4. **Clean Up Transitional Code**:
   - Remove redundant files
   - Remove commented-out code

5. **Documentation**:
   - Create documentation for the DI framework
   - Add usage examples for the services

## Tentative Timeline

- **Week 1 (Remaining)**: Fix project structure and import issues
- **Week 2 (Start)**: Complete service integration and resolve test issues
- **Week 2 (End)**: Clean up code and add documentation

## Lessons Learned

1. Swift module imports can be challenging, especially in a monolithic app structure without proper module separation.

2. Adding dependency injection to an existing codebase requires careful planning to avoid disrupting current functionality.

3. Maintaining backward compatibility during refactoring is crucial to allow for incremental improvements.
