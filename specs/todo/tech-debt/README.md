# Little Moments Tech Debt Initiatives

This directory contains technical specifications for addressing technical debt in the Little Moments application. Each document outlines a specific area for improvement, including context, motivation, implementation plan, and timelines.

## Overview of Tech Debt Areas

The following key areas have been identified for improvement:

1. **Architecture Refactoring**: Moving away from singletons toward dependency injection and proper MVVM architecture
2. **Testing Strategy**: Implementing comprehensive unit and UI testing
3. **Error Handling**: Creating proper error handling and logging mechanisms
4. **UI Modernization**: Updating UI code for consistency and accessibility
5. **Swift Modernization**: Adopting modern Swift features and patterns
6. **Resource Management**: Optimizing memory usage and performance
7. **Documentation Standards**: Creating consistent documentation throughout the codebase

## Priority and Timeline

These initiatives are prioritized based on their impact on app stability, maintainability, and user experience:

| Initiative | Priority | Estimated Effort | Dependencies |
|------------|----------|------------------|--------------|
| Architecture Refactoring | High | 6 weeks | None |
| Error Handling | High | 4 weeks | None |
| Resource Management | High | 5 weeks | None |
| Testing Strategy | Medium | 4 weeks | Architecture Refactoring |
| Swift Modernization | Medium | 8 weeks | Architecture Refactoring |
| UI Modernization | Medium | 5 weeks | None |
| Documentation Standards | Low | 6 weeks | None |

## Getting Started

To begin addressing these tech debt issues:

1. Review each specification document to understand the scope and approach
2. Prioritize based on current project needs and resources
3. Incorporate these initiatives into the development roadmap
4. Begin with architecture refactoring as it enables many other improvements

## Measuring Progress

Progress on these initiatives should be tracked through:

- Regular code quality metrics reviews
- Pull request labeling to identify tech debt improvements
- Documentation of completed items in each initiative
- Periodic reassessment of remaining tech debt
