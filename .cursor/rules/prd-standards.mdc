      # Product Requirement Document (PRD) Guidelines

      When creating Product Requirement Documents for Little Moments:

      ## Location and Format
      - All PRDs must be placed in the `specs/` directory
      - Use Markdown (.md) format for all PRDs
      - Follow a clear naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name.md`
      - A template is available in `specs/TEMPLATE-feature-name.md`

      ## Document Structure
      Every PRD should include these sections:

      1. **Overview**
         - Problem statement: What user/business problem are we solving?
         - Intended impact: How does this improve the user experience or business?
         - Background context: Relevant history or information

      2. **Goals and Success Metrics**
         - Primary goal: The main outcome we want to achieve
         - Success metrics: Specific, measurable indicators of success
         - Non-goals: What's explicitly out of scope

      3. **Requirements**
         - Functional requirements: What the feature must do
         - Non-functional requirements: Performance, reliability, etc.
         - Constraints: Technical, business, or time limitations

      4. **User Experience**
         - User flows: How users will interact with the feature
         - Key screens/interactions: Major touchpoints (can include wireframes)
         - Edge cases: How to handle unusual scenarios

      5. **Implementation Considerations**
         - Dependencies: Other features or systems this relies on
         - Phasing: How this might be rolled out in stages
         - Open questions: Areas needing further investigation

      ## Best Practices
      - Focus on outcomes, not implementation details
      - Be precise about scope: what's in and what's out
      - Use concise language and bullet points
      - Include diagrams where they add clarity
      - Treat the PRD as a living document that will evolve

      ## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
      - Prescribing specific technical solutions
      - Excessive detail that constrains implementation options
      - Vague requirements that can't be verified
      - Missing success metrics or evaluation criteria

      # Feature: Quick Start Widget
      
      ## Overview
      Users need a faster way to start meditation sessions from their home screen.
      This feature will provide a home screen widget that allows one-tap session starts.
      
      ## Goals and Success Metrics
      - Primary goal: Reduce friction to start meditation sessions
      - Success metrics: 
        - 20% increase in daily meditation sessions
        - 15% increase in user retention
      - Non-goals: 
        - Complex widget customization options
        
      ## Requirements
      - Widget must allow starting a session with a single tap
      - Widget should display time since last meditation
      - Widget must work on iOS 16+
      
      ## User Experience
      - Widget appears on home screen with clear "Start" button
      - Tapping launches app directly into a session
      - Widget shows time elapsed since last session
      
      ## Implementation Considerations
      - Depends on WidgetKit framework
      - Could be phased: basic widget first, then add customization
      - Open question: Should we allow duration selection in the widget?
