## Description

Implement Liquid Glass migration per specs/2025-10-05-liquid-glass-migration-prd.md, replacing custom button backgrounds, updating timer controls, and modernizing Settings navigation.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Buttons in TimerStartView and TimerRunningView adopt Liquid Glass button styles without manual Color.blue backgrounds.
- [ ] #2 Timer grids use glassEffect APIs with accessibility fallbacks verified (Reduce Motion, Reduce Transparency).
- [ ] #3 Settings navigation uses NavigationStack + toolbar, no deprecated navigationBarItems.
- [ ] #4 QA checklist from the PRD documented in implementation PR.
<!-- AC:END -->


## Implementation Plan

Phase 0 - Alignment and baseline hygiene
- Re-read specs/2025-10-05-liquid-glass-migration-prd.md with design/product to surface open questions (icon layering, widget tint guidance) before any code changes.
- Confirm the repo builds against the required Liquid Glass SDK locally (fastlane generate) and note any tooling upgrades the team needs to schedule.
- Copy the PRD QA checklist into a working doc so results can be captured as we move through phases.

Phase 1 - Platform baseline and shared tokens
- Raise the deployment target to iOS 26 in Project.swift and related build settings, pruning availability guards and fallback code paths that only exist for older OS versions.
- Add a shared styling module (e.g. LittleMoments/Core/Styling/GlassStyles.swift) that defines GlassButtonStyle wrappers, semantic Color/Shape constants, and typography helpers that map to system defaults.
- Replace legacy Color.blue literals and manual corner radii in reusable components (ImageButton, shared button helpers) with the new tokens to prepare downstream migrations.
- Cover the styling utilities with focused tests or previews (e.g. unit tests ensuring availability fallbacks still compile) so regressions surface quickly when iterating.

Phase 2 - Timer entry surfaces (TimerStartView)
- Swap TimerStartView to the shared Glass button styles, removing bespoke backgrounds and ensuring primary/secondary CTAs expose accessibility labels.
- Update surrounding layout (settings gear, quick duration chips) to use semantic tinting and `.glassEffect` where appropriate, verifying Reduce Motion/Transparency fallbacks inline as you build.
- Exercise existing Timer preset tests and add snapshot/unit coverage if needed to lock the refreshed hierarchy in place.

Phase 3 - Active session glass migration (TimerRunningView)
- Introduce a GlassEffectContainer (or equivalent wrapper) around timer controls, consolidating glass layers to avoid performance spikes.
- Replace manual selection backgrounds in the duration grid and control buttons with `.glassEffect` APIs, using environment-driven accent colors for state changes.
- Present TimerRunningView via `.fullScreenCover` with a dedicated dismissal action, updating any callers and tests that assumed sheet-style presentation.
- Verify dark mode, dynamic type, and accessibility toggles while instrumenting with Instruments or SwiftUI inspection to watch for overdraw/perf regressions.

Phase 4 - Settings navigation modernization
- Migrate SettingsView to NavigationStack and `.toolbar` APIs, removing deprecated `navigationBarItems` usage.
- Adopt grouped Form styling with system background materials, auditing any custom `scrollContentBackground` modifiers that might fight Liquid Glass.
- Update the sheet presentation to `.presentationDetents([.large])` (or appropriate) and ensure reduce-transparency produces a solid fallback background.
- Refresh or add tests covering navigation links and persistence so the refactor does not break existing settings flows.

Phase 5 - Widgets and layered icon handoff
- Apply the shared glass styles to WidgetExtension views, replacing manual opacity and color overlays with Liquid Glass-friendly materials while validating legibility in light/dark and high contrast.
- Document icon layering requirements and create/hand off a task for the actual asset production, ensuring the app and widget reference the updated assets once delivered.
- Run widget snapshot or UI tests if available, otherwise document manual QA steps for verification.

Phase 6 - Accessibility, QA, and rollout prep
- Execute the PRD QA checklist across devices/simulators, explicitly logging Reduce Motion, Reduce Transparency, and performance results.
- Run `fastlane format_code`, `fastlane lint`, and the relevant `fastlane test` lanes, capturing evidence for the implementation PR.
- Prepare release notes, migrate any lingering docs (e.g. backlog/spec updates), and note follow-up tasks for items deferred (icon production, additional polish).


## Implementation Notes

Phase 0 kickoff (2025-10-05)
- Reviewed specs/2025-10-05-liquid-glass-migration-prd.md; QA checklist is not enumerated, so flagged with design/product for follow-up before implementation.
- Attempted to validate tooling with fastlane generate; fastlane command missing and bundle exec fastlane generate fails because Bundler 2.6.6 is unavailable in the sandbox. Need guidance on installing the required Bundler or alternative lane invocation before continuing.
- Created QA checklist stub here to capture results once the checklist is delivered.

QA Checklist Working Stub
- awaiting detailed steps from design/product.

Phase 1 progress (2025-10-05)
- Raised Tuist deployment targets to iOS 26 and trimmed widget container fallbacks that relied on pre-glass OS behavior.
- Introduced LiquidGlassTokens + LiquidGlassButtonStyle scaffolding under Core/Styling to stage shared materials.
- Updated ImageButton to consume the new style so downstream feature views can adopt the wrapper incrementally.

Phase 2 progress (2025-10-05)
- Refreshed TimerStartView controls with LiquidGlassButtonStyle + new icon button wrapper, removing manual Color.blue backgrounds and adding Reduce Transparency fallback surfaces.
- Gear control now exposes an accessibility label and uses semantic tinting; start CTA routes through startSession() helper for cleaner intent donation logging.
- Added LiquidGlassIconButtonStyle + previews so future surfaces (widgets, settings toolbar) can reuse consistent treatments.
- Verified gradient fallback swaps to solid system background when Reduce Transparency is enabled.

Phase 3 progress (2025-10-06)
- Reworked TimerRunningView layout with a reusable glass container, gradient surface, and Reduce Transparency-friendly fallbacks; TimerStartView now presents it via fullScreenCover.
- Introduced LiquidGlass chip modifiers + button roles (accent/neutral/destructive/success) so duration presets and action buttons use semantic tints instead of Color.blue.
- Cancel/Complete actions now rely on the glass button style with destructive/success roles and tighter accessibility identifiers.
- Timer grid buttons use the new chip treatment with chunked layout helpers to avoid word wrapping and keep selection affordances consistent.

Phase 4 progress (2025-10-06)
- Rebuilt SettingsView using NavigationStack + toolbar, modernizing the dismiss affordance and removing navigationBarItems usage.
- Applied Liquid Glass styling: grouped Form with hidden background, semantic tinting, gradient fallback when transparency is available, and a neutral glass icon button for the close control.
- Settings sheet now uses large detents, drag indicator, and rounded corners to align with Liquid Glass modal guidance.

Phase 5 progress (2025-10-06)
- Shared LiquidGlass styling helpers with widget targets and added surface fill/stroke APIs for gradient and fallback handling.
- Refreshed StartMeditationWidget small family UI: gradients now derive from LiquidGlass tokens, quick duration chips and primary CTA use glass treatments, and Reduce Transparency falls back to grouped backgrounds.
- Updated MeditationLiveActivityView container + links to adopt the same glass fills with semantic success/destructive roles, replacing manual Color.blue/red/green usage.

Color tuning (2025-10-06)
- Increased accent/success/destructive opacities in LiquidGlassTokens and piped them through button, icon, and chip styling so controls render with richer tints without abandoning the glass look.

Phase 2 progress (2025-10-08)
- Matched the Start session CTA height to the 64pt Liquid Glass control spec by extending LiquidGlassButtonStyle with an optional controlHeight and updating ImageButton, so the CTA now aligns with the settings control.

Baseline alignment (2025-10-08)
- Raised the documented iOS minimum and simulator targets to iOS 26 / iPhone 17 across AGENTS.md and build architecture notes for consistency.
- Preparing CI and automation updates so Tuist, Fastlane, and GitHub Actions run on iOS 26 simulator baselines.
