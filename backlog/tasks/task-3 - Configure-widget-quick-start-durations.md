## Description

Design a user-friendly way to choose which session lengths appear on the widget quick-start buttons. Explore whether this lives in app settings or via in-widget configuration and document trade-offs. Ensure the chosen approach keeps the list manageable and ordered for fast selection.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Configuration UI allows selecting at least 3 preferred durations from a broader list.
- [ ] #2 Quick-start buttons show the chosen times sorted from shortest to longest and persist across launches.
- [ ] #3 Edge cases covered for when users select fewer or more durations than the widget can display.
