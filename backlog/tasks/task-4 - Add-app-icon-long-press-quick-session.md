## Description

Define and implement a Home Screen quick action so users can start a meditation session directly from the app icon long-press menu. Align on which duration should launch, how it interacts with existing quick actions, and what feedback the user gets when the app opens.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 At least one long-press quick action starts a session without additional taps once the app opens.
- [ ] #2 Behavior documented for when a session is already running or HealthKit permissions are missing.
- [ ] #3 QA notes cover supported devices/iOS versions and any limitations of Home Screen quick actions.
