# Little Moments privacy policy

This app does not collect any data about you. It does not use any third-party services that collect data about you. It does not use any analytics or tracking services. It does not use any advertising services. It does not use any social media services.

The one exception is that the app can use Apple HealthKit to log meditation sessions. This is an opt-in feature that you must enable in the app's settings. If you do enable it, the app will log the start and end times of your meditation sessions, along with the duration of the session, to the Health app. It will also log the number of sessions you have completed. The app does not read any data from HealthKit. The data is stored in your own HealthKit database, managed by you and Apple. You can disable this feature at any time in the app's settings.

Builds of this app come directly from the source code available [on GitHub](https://github.com/ibomash/LittleMoments). You can build the app yourself and install it on your own device if you wish. You can also inspect the source code to verify that it does not collect any data about you.
